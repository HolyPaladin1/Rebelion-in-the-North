Secondly you have no idea about the oppressive cold of the far north.Krshan has told me that many of our soldiers sent there have died due to the bitter cold.So I suggest you remain here to repel any further attacks from the rebels,if they at all come.Krshan knows his stuff very well,and he has the dwarves with him to help.I am sure you will meet your friend soon."
